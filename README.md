# how to build a robot
 building a robot that can do various things.
 
This is howto series of articles.
I thought it would be neat to create a robot that was easy to put together and was also affordable. Following requirements for my robot:

* kits are expensive, so it must be relatively inexpensive.
* easily put together without special equipment.
* easily programmable without a complicated IDE or programmer.
* It must be powerful enough for expandability.
* run off a simple power source.
* able to follow a line or a wall, and avoid obstacles.
